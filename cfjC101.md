## Testing the waters with Coding 101

Having heard their radio ads for years, but thinking it was too late for me to enter this field, it took a chance meeting at a yard sale with a CF alumna to convince me to check this out.

After an intense couple of days of online research, I decided to give it a shot and checkout Coding 101 to see if I could be a good fit for this field.

Coding 101 was a quick-paced workshop offering a glimpse into how to build and deploy a basic web site /(Home page and one subordinate page\).  It offered a light intro into HTML and offered a few handy online resources to assist in finding images and choosing colors.

Working in teams of three or four, half of each team worked on the Home page while the other half worked on the About page.  As the workshop drew to a close, each team linked the two pages and deployed the site.  Then each site was presented to the group by its authors.

It was simple, it was fun, and it pushed one along to not dawdle with the limited working time.  The finished results were simple - some funny, some serious - and none of them were "ready for Prime Time" as we used to say back in the day, but it demystified they heady notion of what it takes to build a web site.

All-in-all, a good day.
