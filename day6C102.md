## Day Six of my Coding 102 Journey

Unit 8 - 

The reading for this unit dealt with How computers work.  As a decades-long electro-mech tech, this is my stomping ground.

The video playlist for the reading discussed the following:  

**_What makes a computer a 'computer'?_** - 
    A computer is a tool that does each of the following - 
    * Takes in information \(**Input**\), 
    * Stores that information \(**Storage**\), 
    * Manipulates that information to change it \(**Processing**\), 
    * and finally sends the result out of the computer \(**Output**\).

Different examples were given of types of input devices, output devices and some of the possible types of output.

Next was a shallow dive into the **_Binary_** world 'inside the box.'
This described how Base 2 works, how that translates to electrical circuits, and the basics of Boolean logic and digital circuitry.

Then, on the way back to the surface, the macro world of computer hardware, software, programs and peripherals \(input and output devices\) were touched on.
This included a brief description of the **_Operating System \(OS\)_** and how it manages the other programs running or stored inside the computer.
