## Day Three of my Coding 102 Journey

**Git and Version Control.**

A **_Version Control System \(VCS\)_** allows the user to have a history of the changes they have mede to a coding project.  Should they need to abandon a branch of development and start again from a stage further back along the path without starting over from scratch, a VCS provides a mechanism for doing so cleanly.

Historically, Version control started locally \(i.e., on the hard drive of the local machine\), with **Local Version Control**.  Soon the need for several Coders to collaborate on a single project brought about the development of **Centralized Version Control System \(CVCS\)**, where the VCS lived on a common server rather than on one local machine.  Like the LVCS before it, the CVCS still held \'all the eggs in one basket.\'  If that machine went down, havoc ensued.  To address this, the next stage of development was for the **Distributed Version Control systems \(DVCS\)** which allows clients to create mirrored repositories \(copies of the same repo on multiple machines\).

**Git** is one of those DVCSs used on the Linux platform, storing changes in a series of **snapshots**.  With Git, copy of a project’s history lives on the local disk, so a Coder doesn't need to clone down a copy from the server every time they want to continue working without having to be online or on a VPN.

Git also manages file integrity to minimize the chance of data corruption or loss.  So files in Git can be in one of three states: committed, modified or staged.

A **Committed** state means data is securely stored in a database on the local machine.

In the **Modified** state, Git flags the file to indicate that the file has been changed, but not yet committed to the database.

When **Staged**, the file’s changed version is flagged to be committed to the master repo in the next snapshot.

The local version \(or *branch*\) of the repo is named the **Master** by Git, and the remote server-based repo from which the Master was originally cloned is dubbed by Git to be the **Origin**.
