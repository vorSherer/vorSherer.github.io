A note about '**Growth Mindset**;'
    Attaining a growth mindset is key to thriving in any demanding situation - personal or professional.  
    Developing a growth mindset entails acknowledging that one is going to fail far more often than one is going to succeed in any new endeavor - to push forward, one must try _something_ to progress - and that something is more likely to fail \(to some degree\) more often than not.  Each failure, however, teaches something; it may have yielded a partial success that may be follow-up on, it may uncover a new possibility one hadn't before considered and take the pursuit in a new direction, or it may show that this particular experiment is a dead end on otherwise not productive to pursue.  One must then be willing to follow-up, to take yet another step in this "...journey of a thousand miles...."


    I intend to develop my Growth Mindset by remembering the following:

    1. Thomas Edison didn't quit at ten, thirty, or even ninety tries when trying to invent the electric lightbulb - and he had only three variables to control.  _I can do this!_

    1. If something responds unexpectedly, inspect and review the details:  
        * What does the error message __read__?
        * What did I actually __input__ to get this result?
        * What can I learn from this result?  Have I looked for a new possibility in it \(to apply here or elsewhere\)?
    1. One rarely appreciates the progress one is making at the time.  Periodically \(especially when things don't seem to be going well\), I will need to take a step back and look at where I was a year previous.  Have I made progress since then?  Can I remember the milestones I have passed?  Am I 'enjoying a better view' now than I was then?  Then take a moment to bask in 'the view,' and remind myself that a year from now this moment will likely be forgotten and I will have moved through it to make yet more progress!  Armed with these reminders, I will dive back into the fray.
