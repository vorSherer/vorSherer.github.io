Greetings, and welcome to my Project!

I am a life-long learner who has not yet learned to pick one thing to learn at a time.  I always have multiple plates spinning at any one time (perhaps you can relate).

Professionally, I have a background in electronics (USAF-trained and IRL-corrected), like to tinker with circuits, and have a Raspberry Pi that I'm still trying to make time to play with.  

I used to build my own computers back in the WIN 3.x era and early WIN 9x era, but now I just use a laptop.

Whenever I get overtaxed with "computer stuff" I'm starting to get into woodworking and building out a woodshop/maker space in my garage.

I am also a bit of an animal-whisperer (though my wife and daughter pronounce it "pet-stealer") as I have a knack for quickly building a  report with their pets.
