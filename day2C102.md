## Day Two of my Coding 102 Journey

One of today's assignments was to describe the differences among the various text editor options a developer might use.

First, it breaks down into three classes: 
1. **Plain text editors** \(e.g., Microsoft's ubiquitous Notepad\)
1. **Coding-specific text editors** \(such as the one I chose, Microsoft's Visual Studio Code, or VSCode for short\)
1. **Integrated Devolopmen Environments \(IDEs\)** - which are not so much text editors as fully-integrated suites of tools built around software development.

Taken in order, **Plain Text editors** are great for raw coding, in that they don't have Reserved characters, so whatever you key in isn't going to trigger a function inside the editor.  The down-side is that the coder has to be **diligent** in closing code segments by hand.  There are no helps to find errors in large blocks of code written in a Plain Text editor.  What you type is what you get - and that's all!    Its *all* on the Coder from there.

**Coding-specific editors** offer a variety of tools to help a Coder debug code on-the-fly and many offer code autocompletion for the specific language one might be working in.  Another common feature is color-coding the commands one enters, so one can spot them in a large block of code.  Quite a step up from Notepad, eh?

IDEs are a whole 'nuther animal.  In addition to a text editor, they typically offer a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.  They offer a *serious* step up from even Code-specific editors with the additional tools **integrated** \(that means they all play nice together\) into one package.

**The Bottom Line; There is no one _Best Choice._** Pick one and try it out.  Then try another and compare the two.  Add another and decide not only which of them fits the work you're doing best, but which one are **_you_** most comfortable with.  Whichever one you settle on - even if its only for a time - _that's_ the best editor.
