## Day Two of my Coding 102 Journey

One of today's assignments was to describe the differences among the various text editor options a developer might use.

First, it breaks down into three classes: 
1. **Plain text editors** \(e.g., Microsoft's ubiquitous Notepad\)
1. **Coding-specific text editors** \(such as the one I chose, Microsoft's Visual Studio Code, or VSCode for short\)
1. **Integrated Devolopment Environments \(IDEs\)** - which are not so much text editors as fully-integrated suites of tools built around software development.

Taken in order, **Plain Text editors** are great for raw coding, in that they don't have Reserved Words or Characters to trip over, so whatever you key in isn't going to trigger a function inside the editor.  The down-side is that the Coder has to be **_diligent_** in closing code segments by hand.  There are no helps to find errors in large blocks of code written in a Plain Text editor.  What you type is what you get - and that's all!    Its *all* on the Coder from there.

**Coding-specific editors** offer a variety of tools to help a Coder debug code on-the-fly and many offer code autocompletion for \(one or more of\) the specific language one might be working in.  Another common feature is color-coding the commands one enters, so one can spot them in a large block of code.  Quite a step up from Notepad, eh?

**IDEs** are a whole 'nuther animal.  In addition to a text editor, they typically offer a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.  They offer a *serious* step up from even Code-specific editors with the additional tools **integrated** \(that means they all play nice together\) into one package.

**The Bottom Line; There is no one _Best Choice._** Pick one and try it out.  Then try another and compare the two.  Add another and decide not only which of them fits the work you're doing best, but which one are **_you_** most comfortable with.  Whichever one you settle on - even if its only for a time - _that's_ the best editor.  




Another required assignment was to read specified material on using Linux commands in Terminal \(the "Command Line" shell of Linux\).

Here are a few of the highlights of what I learned from my reading.  

Linux is a case-sensitive operating system - thus two otherwise-identical files, one with one or more capital letters ine either the name _or the extension_ are seen as distinct filenames by the operating system.  

In Linux, *EVERYTHING* is a file - files, directories, etc.  So any *pathname* points to a file, regardless of how humans might normally view the target.  
- On a related note, a dot before a filename indicates a hidden file.  Thus any file may be changed to or from hidden status simply by renaming it with an added or removed dot in front of its previous name.

Also, Linux looks at extensions as part of the filename, but ignores them when deciding what type of file a file is. Thus renaming a .png file to a .txt file will not fool Linux.  It knows that the file is still an image file.

Some commands we leqrned about included the following:  
*__pwd__ - Tells Linux to __Print Working Directory__ \(i.e., show where you are in the directory structure\).
*__ls \[options\] \[location\]__ - *List* the files in the specified *location* according to the constraints of the *option* listed.
*__cd \[location\]__ - Tells Linux to __Change Directories__ to that specified in the *location* argument.
*__file \[path\]__ - Requests Linux display __file__ type information for the file specified in the _path_.

I also learned how to use **./**, **~/** and **../** to navigate the Linux Directory Structure.


Happy Coding!
