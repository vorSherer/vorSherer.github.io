## Day One of my Coding 102 Journey

I would have put the Growth Mindset entry here, but instruction explicitly directed that that entry should be placed on the Home \(README.md\) page.

Note to Self:  Keep up with the Reading and Labs and get the quizzes done on time. Playing catch-up doesn't play well with keeping up - not in this rapid-paced environment!

##### MARKDOWN - Like HTML, only smaller.

**MARKDOWN** strikes me as a _very_ stripped-down version of a Mark-up Language, used to simply format text on a web page.  It's like taking a plain-text file and converting it to rich-text so you can apply some format enhancements, but for the web.

GitHub adds its own customized enhancements to Markdown with **GitHub Flavored Markdown** - adding some handy features \(and even supports emoji!\).

The GitHub Pages video described the capabilities and benefits of using GitHub Pages to convert projects into web content.

The reading wrapped up with a reference to GitHub Markdown Syntax and how to use _escape characters_ to ignore the RESERVED meaning of certain characters when using them in a mundane text passage.
