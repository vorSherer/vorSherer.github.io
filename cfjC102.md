## Taking the Plunge - Diving in with Coding 102

So, having decided to 'ride this horse until I get knocked off,' and having taken a taste with Coding 101, I decided to jump in with both feet and try to make this work.

Below is a chronicle of my Coding 102 experience.

[Day 1](day1C102.md) - Getting started with MARKDOWN and GitHub

[Day 2](day2C102.md) - Building my Developer's Environment

[Day 3](day3C102.md) - Introduction to HTML and CSS

[Day 4](day4C102.md) - Designing and building a web site as a team
