## Day Four of my Coding 102 Journey

Hoooo-boy!  Eight semi-grueling hours of trying to keep up!

Career Coaching Intro - Tihis was left to self-study later.  

This unit addresses how Career Coaching will be handled in each level of the CF curriculum.  The intro summarized the following:  

### Launching a new career in tech -
**Your Pitch** - Have your professional pitch (elevator pitch) always ready.  Try it out with friends, tweak it to get it better, then practice it constantly until it almost becomes subconscious.  
**Your Network** - More jobs come through your personal network of family, friends, and business associates than come from resume-mills and job boards.  KEEP GOING BACK TO and KEEP EXPANDING your network.  
**Your Quarry** - Learn how to target companies to win a place there.  
**Your Preparedness** - Have your stuff together and ready to go - Think of it like your 'Go Bag' if you're subjectto deployment.  (You civvies out there might think of it as your emergency kit for when "the Big One" hits.)  Be ready, or miss out!  
**Your Portfolio** - Have samples of your work ready for Prime Time.  

Future installments of Career Coaching will build on **_The Seven Pillars of Career Coaching_**:
* Professional etiquette
* Professional pitch
* Creating a network
* Job search readiness
* The Targeted job search
* Professional materials
* Answering Behavioral interview questions

The "Lab Portion of this unit described the required elements in setting up a LinkedIn account and drafting a starter Resume.


**Unit 4 - HTML**; HyperText Mark-up Language \(specifically HTML 5\) - Building the **CONTENT** of your site.

All readings below were from the _Duckett: HTML & CSS_ text.

**Chapter 18** dealt with the considerations that go into **Process & Design** of a web site - Thinking through to following; 
* **Who is the site for?** - What entity or demographic is the site content targeted to?
* **Why do visitors come to a/your site?** - Taking the **_goals_** and **_motivations_** of your visitors into consideration so you can design the delivery of results that meet those goals and expectations.  
    * Think through what your target audience wants to achieve or accomplish - Do they need general information?.  Do they need time-sensitive or transitory information?  Are they looking for information suitable to research, or to guide a buying decision?  Match your content to the delivery of your intended product - tangible or informational.
    * Think through what information your target audience needs - devise a way to deliver it quickly.
    * Think through how often a particular visitor is likely to visit - Static information \(that which doesn't change, or doesn't change much\) is fine for reference or research visits, but Dynamic information \(subject to constant - and sometimes rapid - change\) needs to be refreshed in a timely fashion, or visitors will find a more responsive site elsewhere.
* **Site Maps** - They help users shortcut navigation to find desired content more quickly \(if it is properly designed\).

Techniques for designing the web site include **_WireFraming_**, **_Layout_** using _visual heirarchy_ \(emphasizing importance and/or relatedness using variations in placement, size, color and style\), and **_Navigation design_** - making site navigation as intuitive as one can.

**Chapter 1** - This reading introduced the **_Structure of HTML_**, describing how properly written HTML code is written, organized and how Mark-up effects the code.

**Chapter 17** - This reading dove deeper into HTML5 Layout, describing the organization of the HTML pagecode and some of the tags that are used or available to code the site content.

**Chapter 8** - This reading gave some history on the development from HTML4 to HTML5, then discussed tags to use - what they do and how to use them correctly - and concluded with a short list of handy _escape characters_ \(characters that have a RESERVED meaning in HTML, but that one may wish to use in content. Escape Characters show how to include these characters in text content that won't invoke the RESERVED function when doing so\).


**Unit 5 - CSS**; Cascading Style Sheets \(specifically CSS 3\) - Composing the **APPEARANCE** or PRESENTATION of your content.

**Chapter 10** introduced CSS, describing what it does, the anatomy of its _rules_, how to link one or more *CSS* documents to an *HTML* file, the rules of precedence for resolving application among multiple CSS rules for the same HTML element \(e.g., which of three CSS rules applies to this HTML element?\).  The chapter concludes with an arguement for using an _external CSS document_ \(a CSS file separate from the HTML file\) rather than the older practice of _internal style documentation_ \(i.e., embedding CSS rules in a "style" section in the <head> of the HTML file.\) and a discussion of Browser quirks and CSS Bugs.

**Chapter 11** was all about color - describing four ways to specify a color, some tools for identifying the color you seek, considerations of contrasting background to text for greater readability, and using fall-back color declarations ahead of **hsl/hsla** color declarations so that Browsers that don't support _hsl/hsla_ know what to do instead.


**Unit 6 - Introducing JavaScript** - Making web sites *DO* stuff.
