## Day Four of my Coding 102 Journey

Hoooo-boy!  Eight semi-grueling hours of trying to keep up!

Career Coaching Intro - Tihis was left to self-study later.  

This unit addresses how Career Coaching will be handled in each level of the CF curriculum.  The intro summarized the following:  

### Launching a new career in tech -
**Your Pitch** - Have your professional pitch (elevator pitch) always ready.  Try it out with friends, tweak it to get it better, then practice it constantly until it almost becomes subconscious.  
**Your Network** - More jobs come through your personal network of family, friends, and business associates than come from resume-mills and job boards.  KEEP GOING BACK TO and KEEP EXPANDING your network.  
**Your Quarry** - Learn how to target companies to win a place there.  
**Your Preparedness** - Have your stuff together and ready to go - Think of it like your 'Go Bag' if you're subjectto deployment.  (You civvies out there might think of it as your emergency kit for when "the Big One" hits.)  Be ready, or miss out!  
**Your Portfolio** - Have samples of your work ready for Prime Time.  

Future installments of Career Coaching will build on **_The Seven Pillars of Career Coaching_**:
* Professional etiquette
* Professional pitch
* Creating a network
* Job search readiness
* The Targeted job search
* Professional materials
* Answering Behavioral interview questions
