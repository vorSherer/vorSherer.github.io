## Day Five of my Coding 102 Journey

Because Saturday was three lecutures \(four, five and six\), calendar Day 5 equated to \'Assignment Day 7\', where we began to dive into JavaScript.

The day's reading started off with conventions used in the text, then shifted to a familiarization with how programming works.  That is, understanding how a computer views code; the process it goes through to execute the instructions it has been given.

Where **HTML** is used to describe the **content** of a web site, and **CSS** is used to detail the **appearance** of that content \(that is, how it will be displayed for the reader\), the job of **JavaScript** is to *execute scripts* that interact with the HTML and CSS of a given web page.

There are four ways that JavaScript can interact with a web page:  
1. It can **access content** to target a particular element or find out what was entered into a text input.
1. It can **modify content** to the page, injecting new code instructions to the page code based on *scripts* it runs.  This new code can add content or change the code of existing content of the page. These changes hold for as long as one is on the page; navigate away and come back, and you're back to the page's original content.
1. It can add **program rules** for the browser to follow to apparently animate the site for the reader - like sequencing a gallery of photos that will change at a specified length of time even with no user input.  These rules can also interact with user input to display results of their input.
1. Finally, JavaScript can **react** to events on the web page: to do something when a specified thing happens; a button or link is clicked on, a mouse-over is detected, an online form entry is made or an interval of time has passed, like display a timeout warning after a specified time has elapsed, from when the page was first displayed or after a specified time that the page has been idle.  

The steps a Coder takes are as follows:  
1. **Define a Goal** - Know what it is one wants to accomplish.
1. **Design a script** - A *script* is a sequence of steps, followed like a recipe, that when followed execute a desired action. 
To get the scripts to do what you want, when you want, to create a good user experience, one needs to be mindful of how a computer handles code and design each script to apply that knowledge to do what one intends to do.
1. **Sketch out the Tasks** - One common method of thinking through the computer mind is with **Flowcharting** - thinking though the steps that a computer will follow one-by-one.  By looking at things from the computer's perspective, the Coder can better structure the content and sequencing of his or her instructions.

The material then got into some theory, defining *expressions* and breaking an expression down into its components.  Then *Operators* were discussed and the two classes of operators, *arithmatic* and *string* were described and contrasted.

Armed with this foundation, the text next lead into describing **Functions** - what they are and how they work.  Discussed were the stages of *Declaring a Function* \(coding what you want the function to do and what it will work with\) and *Calling the Function* \(invoking it when you want it to perform, so it isn't running when unintended\).

Heady stuff, but I'm following it so far.
