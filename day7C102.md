## Day Seven of my Coding 102 Journey

Unit 9 - "Hurray for Arrays and other Objects d'Art!"

OK, a little tongue-in-cheeck, but hey, this late in the game we need a little humor, neh?

Today's reading started with **Arrays** - a sort of 'group variable.' These can be used to group related variable data in one place.
Items contained in an array have a machine-assigned **index** number assigned to them, in the order in which they were stored in the array - much like apartment numbers in an apartment complex.  In addition to using the data stored in an array in one's code, each array has a property called '**length**' \(syntax: _arrayname_.length\) that tracks the number of items in that array.  One can use this value dynamically when coding \(e.g., declare a variable = _arrayname_.length, then manipulate data using the vaiable.\), as well.

The rest of today's reading was  on **Objects** - what they are, what they are comprised of and what one can do with them.  **Objects** are composed of variables called **_properties_**, and functions called **_methods_**.  These properties and methods all relate to the Object they are a part of.  Think of a car lot - the dealership has a name \(a property\), a number of cars on the lot \(also a property\), etc.  The Dealer can keep track of inventory by subtracting the number of cars sold by the end of a given day from the number of cars on the lot at the beginning of that day \(a method\).  This same method can be used over a span of a month, quarter or year, operating the same way as it did for the day, just with different stating and ending numbers of cars.
